## Deprecation Notice

This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. All CLI functionality has been integrated into the bin directory of the main Dartstream framework.

The `ds_tools_cli` package was part of the early Dartstream ecosystem but has been superseded by the enhanced CLI tools located in the bin/ds_cli.dart file within the Dartstream framework. To ensure consistency and better support for developers, this package is no longer updated.

Migration Guide:
- Replace references to `ds_cli_util` with the `ds_cli.dart` file in the `bin` folder.
- Update your scripts to use the new CLI commands.
