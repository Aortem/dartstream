# DartStream CLI (Deprecated)

## **⚠️ Notice of Deprecation**

**This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.**  
Please use the new CLI tools provided in the `bin` folder of the DartStream framework.  

We highly recommend migrating to the new tools for the latest features, updates, and support.

## Core CLI Package (Deprecated)

The DartStream CLI previously offered a range of features to support the DartStream framework effectively. However, these features are now fully integrated into the main DartStream framework and accessible via its `bin` tools.

### Previously Available Features:
- **Project Initialization**: Scaffolding of new DartStream projects.
- **Build Automation**: Support for code generation and automated tasks.
- **Testing**: Integration with `test` package for unit and integration tests.
- **Mocking**: Compatibility with `mockito` or `mocktail`.
- **Code Coverage**: Coverage reporting with the `coverage` package.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Custom scripts for the DartStream environment.

### **Migrating to the New Tools**
The new DartStream framework CLI tools are located in the `bin` folder. To migrate:
1. Ensure you have the DartStream framework installed.
2. Access the CLI tools directly from the `bin` directory.
3. Refer to the official [DartStream documentation](link-to-docs) for migration guidance.

### **Installation (Deprecated)**

Installation of this package is no longer supported. Existing installations will continue to work but may lack compatibility with future versions of DartStream.

If you need to use this package temporarily, install it with the following (not recommended):  
```bash
dart pub global activate dartstream_cli
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Continued use of this package may result in unsupported behavior or incompatibility with DartStream.
