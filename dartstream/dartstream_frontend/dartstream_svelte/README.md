Explanation of Each Folder
public/:

Contains assets that need to be served directly to the browser. This may include icons, index files, and other static assets. This folder is typically served as-is by the server (or CDN) without transformation.
src/:

components/: Holds reusable components unique to each framework, such as buttons, forms, or cards. This allows you to reuse these pieces in multiple places within the same project.
stores/ (Svelte) and store/ (Vue): Handles application state management. Svelte has a more lightweight store setup, while Vue uses Vuex for state management.
routes/ (Svelte) and views/ (Vue): Define the primary navigation routes or views for the app. Each folder allows the framework to handle single-page application (SPA) navigation effectively.
main.js: The main entry point where the app initializes. This is where you import dependencies, attach the app to the DOM, and configure any app-wide settings.
static/:

Similar to assets/ in Flutter, this folder contains static files such as SVGs, fonts, and images that don’t change often and are bundled or served as part of the app.
config/ (Optional):

Environment-specific configurations or setup files. For instance, you could store API endpoint configurations here, or create .env files that the CLI or build tools can pick up to differentiate between development, staging, and production settings.
package.json:

Specifies dependencies and scripts unique to each framework. Here, you’ll define dependencies like svelte, vue, axios, or other libraries that the framework uses.
README.md:

Each framework should have its own README detailing setup instructions, dependencies, and any unique considerations for that specific frontend. This is useful for guiding developers through platform-specific configurations.
